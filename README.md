# Sample-Software-Requirements-Document

DATE: November 2017

This is an example of a Software Design Requirements report based off of an artificial 
mobile application for university students. It is, however, based off of design 
requirements specified by real people and potential users, through live conversations in-person.

It demonstrates technical writing and shows how applying HCI research is used to help 
developers and software designers understand how to build better applications.
